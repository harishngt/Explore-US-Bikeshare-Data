# Explore-US-Bikeshare-Data
Explore US Bikeshare Data Project, Udacity's Data Visualization with Microsoft Power BI for ATCI Nanodegree

***

## Description
In this project, you will write Python code to import US bike share data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. You will also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

## Rubric

### Code Quality
| CRITERIA                       | MEETS SPECIFICATIONS                                                       |
| ------------------------------ |----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  Functionality of code|  All code cells can be run without error.  |
|  Choice of data types and structures|  Appropriate data types (e.g. strings, floats) and data structures (e.g. lists, dictionaries) are chosen to carry out the required analysis tasks.  |
|  Use of loops and conditional statements|  Loops and conditional statements are used to process the data correctly.  |
|  Use of packages|  Packages are used to carry out advanced tasks.  |
|  Use of functions|  Functions are used to reduce repetitive code.  |
|  Use of good coding practices|  Docstrings, comments, and variable names enable readability of the code.  |

### Script and Questions
| CRITERIA                       | MEETS SPECIFICATIONS                                                       |
| ------------------------------ |----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  Solicit and handle raw user input  |  Raw input is solicited and handled correctly to guide the interactive question-answering experience; no errors are thrown when unexpected input is entered. <br><Br> User inputs should be made case insensitive, which means the input should accept the string of "Chicago" and its case variants, such as "chicago", "CHICAGO", or "cHicAgo". <Br><Br> You should also implement error handlings so your program does not throw any errors due to invalid inputs. For example, if the user enters "Los Angeles" for the city, the error handling should reject the user input and avoid breaking the codes.|
|  Use descriptive statistics to answer questions about the data. Raw data is displayed upon request by the user.  |  Descriptive statistics are correctly computed and used to answer the questions posed about the data. Raw data is displayed upon request by the user in this manner: Script should prompt the user if they want to see 5 lines of raw data, display that data if the answer is 'yes', and continue these prompts and displays until the user says 'no'.  |
